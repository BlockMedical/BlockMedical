In order to exchange BMD tokens with Ethereum, you will need to have:

* An ERC20 Ethereum wallet such as [MetaMask](https://github.com/BlockMedical/BlockMedical/blob/master/docs/metamaskdocs/chrome_metamask_installation.md) if using Chrome (Safari is **NOT** supported)
* You will need to deposit Ethereum to your ERC20 Ethereum wallet. You can go to exchanges such as Coinbase or Binance to fund your ERC20 Ethereum wallet.
* After funding your wallet with Ethereum, you can exchange for BMD tokens.

The following examples uses Chrome with MetaMask extension:

# How to Add ERC20 BMD Symbol to your ERC20 Wallet

The BMD Symbol may not be default or populated by Metamask from the beginning, in order to see this on
Metamask, you will need to register the BMD Symbol Address which is **0xD9a2Dc793E1BBce46e2A7E766D7C76FDaF465E48** (Do **NOT** send Ethereum to this address, this is not the public sales address).

If you need more instructions on how to add this to Metamask, see [here](https://github.com/BlockMedical/BlockMedical/blob/master/docs/metamaskdocs/add_token_symboles/README.md)
