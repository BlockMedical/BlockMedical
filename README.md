# BlockMedical
This is a collection of the application that interact with the Ethereum smart contract for BlockMed tokens.
The application here are incentivized to interact with the contract by contributing your data to IPFS and
register them on Ethereum smart contract BMD (TBD-address). When you start integrating and interacting with
the contract by uploading and registering your IPFS hash for your wallet, you will be granted `BMD` tokens
from the Smart Contract that can be used ot interact with other applications build out that utilize the
same Smart Contract and BMD ERC20 tokens.

# Smart Contract and Blockchain Privacy
## Ethereum and Smart Contract
We provide the ERC20 on Ethereum for the incentive of sharing data and code ownership within the BlockMed community.

## Blockchain Privacy
We need to maintain privacy on user's data such as health records (HIPAA) or privacy on user inputs for secure computation involving Enigma, Ekiden, and SGX hardware, etc.
