# BlockMedical
This is a collection of the application that interact with the Ethereum smart contract to **use** BMD tokens.
The applications here are designed to utilize the code and data uploaded by using your BMD. 
When you start integrating and interacting with the contract to download code and data, you will need access to your
wallet to issue transactions that will use your `BMD` tokens designed in the Smart Contract and BlockMed eco-system.

# How to Access Code and Data

Prerequisite:
1. You will need to have Docker installed first, see: https://docs.docker.com/install/
2. Firefox browser needs to be installed along with MetaMask

Install and Run:
